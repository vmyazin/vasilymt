      "content": "My Favorite MoviesI have been influenced by cinema since a young age. Films shaped my world view and inspired me to travel. On this page I want to share some of my top movies with you.eXistenZ1999 • Director: David CronenbergRushed to the theatres to compete in basically the same genre as The Matrix this film is a treat for all lovers of layered realities where one doesn’t know what’s genuine and what’s imaginary.In the plot people are able to play full-immersion games and organically exist in designed worlds.If you listen to electronic music, you might pick up on a quote or two that you already heard in a song.From Dusk Till Dawn1996 • Director: Robert RodriguezThe director credit is often mistakenly attributed to Tarantino because of how similar to his the grimey style of this movie is. And Quentin indeed plays one of the lead roles, along with George Clooney.Criminals and their captives take shelter at a truck stop populated with vampires, which leads to chaotic results.It is enough to watch this epic film for Salma Hayek's brilliant sexy appearance.The Game1997 • Director: David FincherI love a film that authentically surprises the audience with a plot twist, keeping them on edge all the way to the last frame. Writing this is almost a spoiler for this illusive picture with the venerable Michael Douglas.Among the many things I admire about this movie is that it is set in San Francisco, a city I once called home.Pulp Fiction1994 • Director: Quentin TarantinoThe legendary flick that put Tarantino on the map world-wide made a lasting impression on me. The almost randomly shuffled scenes were starkly original compared to the chronological timelines of 90% of the movies.Also, you gotta love the tastfully delivered scenes of violence.Side NotesSite Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

      "content": "PostsPhoto by Ruel Madelo, taken in Badian, PhilippinesGuilt-free Recharging Is EssentialSimon Myazin,September 4th, 2020It is easy to forget that taking some rest is essential. Somehow it is drilled into us, the wanna-be hustler types, that we must work and only take minimal rest. It seems like if you want to achieve something outstanding you must not lay your head down even on the weekends.It looks like it when we examineinfluential people's social media. They sure look like they never rest, and spit out pearls of wisdom on Twitter even on weekends and late at night. What is vastly overlooked is the need to take substantial breaks from your daily tasks and long-term missions. It concerns those who are on the introverted side, like myself, even more. If for several days straight I'm deeply involved in conversations and problem solving in a collective, be it online or in-person, it is imperative for me to take a break in solitude. And even then the guilty feeling that I'm not spending my time on something practical, something that will move the needle, creeps up.I don't consider myself an ultra-high-achieving person, and maybe that's why this program runs in the back of my head at all times telling me that I'm not “there\" yet, hence I need to keep on “achieving.” It is actually work for me to try and not forget that it's okay to take an occasional break and pat myself on the back for whatever goal I've fulfilled so far, in life or just that day.Awareness Is Key To Retraining Of Your MindFor me it has been a very long process adjusting, trying to do something constantly, powering through, failing due to the lack of fresh energy and not noticing that I am simply tired. It is almost shameful to admit that I can get worn out sometimes. After all, my job is informational, most of my activities are informational in nature – I'm not unloading barges at the docks or training for a marathon.You probably heard this type of thinking shared online or by someone in your circle many a time. But I'm here to remind you, and myself, that it is always a good idea to take a conscious break. Shifting from making a decision that doesn't come easily this evening to tomorrow morning, or even a few days in the future is not a reason to feel guilty. In fact, it is fine to feel guilty for a split second, become aware of that feeling and let it pass, like everything else. With awareness it won’t be harmful, it will merely be observed and continue teaching you to pace yourself.Know The Difference Between Resting and SlackingBut how do you know the difference? Is it procrastinating or putting it off until your mind is in a better state to return to work? If you have to wonder, you probably already know the answer. Don’t oversubscribe, don’t feel shameful sharing how you feel with those who expect results from you, do check in with yourself and regularly refer to yourto-do lists. The balance is never truly found neither is it set in stone but being aware of needing to reflect on your current state will help you dance the dance of life.Tags:restproductivityintrovertsrechargePrevious\"How I Keep Grounded While Traveling Frequently\"Next\"Skipping A Meal Brings You Closer To Your Ancestors\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

In my own life, I have probably spent more than 867 hours improving my workflows.I'm not a fan of complicated systems like GTD. Cal Newport's\"Deep Work\"approach is more my style.\"I hope whatever you're doing you are stopping now and then and not doing it at all.\" — Ram DassHere's how I first got interested in productivity:For the longest time, I thought I was accomplishing quite a lot. Then, about two years ago, I began working with a business coach who was able to pinpoint ways in which I was wasting time and procrastinating.One stormy summer evening in South Florida I was in my room, on a Zoom call with the coach who at the time was on an island in Thailand.He shared with me that he had given up on music as a hobby in order to pursue his goal togain freedom. To get his business up and runninghe had to sacrificea lot of pleasant activities.He told me to remove all games from my iPhone, stop watching YouTube and Netflix for entertainment, and drop a number of superfluous but dopamine-inducing things that didn't help me advance toward my goals.It's a verydelicate balancebetween achieving results and spending recreational time.You must be tuned in to the sense of where you're simply procrastinating versus recharging.So my goal over the next year is:Recognizewhen I do things that don't matter andstopdoing them.I don't want to learn yet another technique to be more productive.What's important is to never lose sight of where yourtimegoes and make a judgment about whether or not was spent wisely. After all, it's the only resourcewe cannot make more of.Tags:productivityPrevious\"This Is The Best Book I've Ever Read On Modern Nomads\"Next\"How to Choose a Digital Nomad-Friendly City to Stay for a Month (Or Longer)\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

      "content": "PostsIn this post I share my ways to keep organized and get stuff doneHow I Stay Productive With My To-Do ListsSimon Myazin,August 15th, 2020Trusting your own memory to keep you organized and on top of things is foolish. It may be a matter of pride: “look at me, I can juggle all of these things in my head, I take hold of whatever comes my way and I deal with it.” I still catch myself thinking this way. But I know better. I have ways to keep myself organized and get stuff done. I’ll admit before going further that my ways are pretty rudimentary and can surely be optimized, yet here I am, sharing what I know and what works for me.Method 1: Sticky NotesThose bright notes, also known by the popular brand name Post-It by 3M, typically yellow, have been a well-known weapon at any office around the world. First introduced in 1979, they became an indispensable tool to help people to stay on track. You can buy them at any pharmacy or grocery store these days.I usually keep a stack on my desk and make a short list of actionable items for the day. Normally, one note fits 5-7 items with my handwriting. I detach the filled note and stick it somewhere on the desk, either its surface or a computer screen, sometimes to the left of the laptop trackpad, if I really want to make sure I don’t miss it.My format goes like this:A dash (the minus sign), followed by a sentence, always starting with a verb. It’s usually as concise as possible without being too cryptic.When I’m done with the task, I change the minus to a plus sign, that’s how I know it’s marked completed.After completing the last remaining item the sheet has served its purpose and I crumple it up and toss it into the rubbish bin. This process brings me a healthy degree of satisfaction and I gotta say, I swear by it.Method 2: Voice Assistant (Siri)There are times when I am not at my desk and cannot write down on a sticky note. Sometimes I’m on the go and I think of something I’d love to remember at some point. How I wish I had a personal assistant there with me to jot it down and remind me when I need to execute. Luckily, these days we have ubiquitous smartphones in our pockets, or in my case an Apple Watch on my wrist. I leave my todo management to Siri. I either long-press the crown of the watch or say “Hey Siri,” followed by something like “Remind me to do laundry tomorrow at 11am”, “Remind me to call Michael at 9pm on Wednesday.”, or “Remind me to review VPN subscription in 354 days.”Having the habit of letting Siri know then and there ensures that I won’t forget to follow up. Snoozing and putting off the reminder, when it comes, is a different story, but at least I’m aware.Between these two methods of getting stuff done I address most of my personal and professional needs. Granted, there are more intricate and nuanced tools for collaborative work, like kanban boards and such, but for me these two stuck as most effective. I am not a fan of to-do apps for a computer or a smartphone, for some reason I don’t get the same level of satisfaction and I tend to forget about them over time.This is what works for me, how about you?

      "content": "PostsPhoto by Jenny Hill on UnsplashHow To Convert Exercise Into A Manifestation Of AchievementSimon Myazin,October 13th, 2020Years ago I had an epiphany. I realized that I can connect performing an enduring physical exercise (running, weight training, taking a hot sauna) to a goal fixed in my mind. I pick the most pertinent goal of the current stage of life and imagine that focusing on the exercise is a rehearsal for achieving the goal.The science backs up the innate desire to achieveThe desire to achieve something is natural for human beings. No matter what your age, gender, social status, you always want to move on to the next level. The next level may not be in the upward direction. You can move sideways, or even down below, if it so suits your agenda. Yet, reaching a goal post is not the basis for long-term happiness. It’s the infinite string of goals that keeps us yearning to live and even functions as the meaning of existence.I don’t claim this to be the only philosophy of life, but if the topic  I’m uncovering here excites you, you know we are on the same page.We don’t need to assume that the acquisition path is limited to material possessions. Even in Buddhism the goal is achievement, although it’s  Nirvana – the ultimate state.NeuroscientistJaak Panksepp postulatesthat of seven fundamental instincts in the human brain (anger, fear, panic-grief, maternal care, pleasure/lust, play, and seeking), seeking is the most important. “The world isn’t fixed, it’s always changing, so that means you have to create anew in light of the changes,” Jaak states.How to get the most mental benefit out of physical exerciseAbout 12 years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles, I was transitioning from a wobbly career of a freelance web designer to a more professional role in a large company. Trust me, there are many things you can learn from working in a collective, the stuff you’d never know as a freelancer. Anyway, I was struggling to position myself favorably with my portfolio and resume. Around the same time I got into running.Not having been into running before, I took it easy at first: ½ a mile around the block, then a mile, then 1½, then 2. Gradually, over the coming weeks, I became tougher. Somewhere in the middle of the process, using my imagination, I began connecting my improvements in running with the projection of getting the job I wanted, with making more money, with growing as a professional. Each lap had a theme: “crushing an interview”, “becoming a high performer”, “turning into a well-to-do man who can take care of his family and friends”.After about a month I rocked the job interview and began working at a firm of my dreams. I wouldn’t assign the reason for achieving my goal solely to the running exercise but it certainly served as a manifestation framework.Recently one of my mentors introduced me to the “feet in the ice bucket” challenge. The idea is to feel up a bucket with cold water and top it off with ice cubes to make sure it’s seriously cold. Then I submerge my feet up to the ankles into the water and stay in for at least 3 minutes. I can barely describe the feelings and emotions that the exercise stirs up in me. I want to scream, curse, jump out of the bucket, throw my arms up in the air. Yet, the point is to stay focused, train your body and every muscle to be still, and breathe.This exercise even more so than running teaches me to be present, let go of the noise in my mind, stay patient, persistent and non-reactive.Examples of enduring activities:hot saunayoga, regular or hotweight trainingcold showermeditation (more enduring when done for 15+ minutes)long distance swimmingfastingTry it next time: connect a physical or mental exercise with a goal you are trying to achieve. There are no rules on how to do it, use your imagination and see how it turns out.Did it resonate with you? Share this on your favorite social media.

      "content": "PostsPhoto by Jaime Spaniol, taken in Armação dos Búzios, BrazilHow To Deal With Perfectionism Without Being Afraid of Imperfect ResultsSimon Myazin,September 14th, 2020Getting desired results for set goals is incredibly important. After all, when we get fired up by an idea and set it in motion, we want to achieve something that in the end will resemble what we had in mind.Practice self-examination to address chronic perfectionismThis may not concern everyone but there is a fair chunk of the population that suffers from perfectionism, often without even knowing it. How do I know when a serious case of perfectionism hits me? Given that all of the necessary elements are accomplished:I can’t seem to reach or simply define the finish lineMy mood changes from feeling excited and enthusiastic to tenseI imagine “the crowd” judging me for not delivering best-in-class outcomeI keep putting off publishing or sharing because I need to add “just one more thing”These attributes yield the awareness of my being stuck in the perfection purgatory and prompt me to take action to remedy the situation.Learn to know when to stop improving on a projectNow begins the real tough-to-acquire skill: knowing when to stop working on a thing. Truthfully, I may never develop a perfect method – see what I did here? – because for the scrupulous maker no one thing is ever truly finished. Like writing this blog post, for instance, is a case of me potentially wanting to include some studies, references to other articles, hard facts etc., beef it up, instead of getting it to the “good enough” state and hitting “Publish.”Another example. I’ve been working on the personal website project – the one you are reading this article from – for a few years now. Some time after I kicked it off, I stopped because the desire to perfect it parallized me. It was easier to drop it altogether than to implement what I had and add incremental changes later. So I released the first version, then a year later I got together with my close friends to brain-storm further additions to the site. My perfectionist friends, well-intentioned as they are, cornered me with their valid questions like “Who are you making it for?” and “What exactly are you trying to achieve by placing this type of content there?” I didn’t have answers that satisfied them and it got me frozen. I didn’t touch the project for another year because my inner perfectionist got defeated by pointed questions. I later came to a realization that action begets action and that I simply needed to aim for a less-than-perfect outcome. So I began adding elements, section by section, until a more mature product started to shape up.I have a strong propensity for aiming high when working on my projects and even when helping others. It’s a years’ long struggle to be able to pause, take stock and detect that my urge to bring something to a flawless condition is a fool’s errand.Perfect is the enemy of the Good. Yet, Good is the enemy of the Good Enough.The bottom line is, achieving absolute perfection is unattainable, and intensifying effort to reach that ideal state leads to diminishing returns. Don’t take this as a permission to do a sloppy job. Be aware of the baseline standards in any given situation, and aim for that. Perfection is a gentle and demanding animal and it only deserves being followed faithfully when:\nyou have an unlimited amount of time to reach it\nyou hit a stroke of genius\nyou have done a number of iterations that made your effort work in the real world, and now, by adding more effort, you naturally break onto the next levelSide note: my opinion here is only meant to unblock you, the reader, not to discourage you to aim for greatness. Remember, that a phenomenal result, something you can be proud of, consists of a long series of seemingly mundane tasks.By the time you find this post, it might be past its first publishable iteration. That may mean you have witnessed a feat of perfection. :)Tags:perfectionismproductivityresultsPrevious\"One Startling Realization About Sleep\"Next\"How I Keep Grounded While Traveling Frequently\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

I realized it during a road trip with the help of a friend of mine. Early in the morning we woke up in a nice two-bed hotel room in Washington DC where we stayed for one night. He asked me: “How did you sleep?”“Not great, but okay,” I said.“I didn’t get much sleep. Not sure why. Imagine hundreds or thousands of years ago our ancestors lived in rough environments.”“Right, surrounded with wild animals and brutal weather conditions. They had to sleep with eyes half-opened in case a threat came near. They survived. It’s got to be natural to not have a deep sleep every night, far from it.”“Exactly what I’m thinking,” my travel companion nodded.There is a common tendency to attempt to sleep well every night. It’s a rational desire but impossible to achieve if you don't create perfect conditions. As a frequent traveler I cannot expect luxuries of the modern world: satin sheets, orthopedic pillows, high-grade foam mattresses, cool flow gel memory foam toppers. I deal with sudden noises, uncomfortable temperatures, forgetting my eye mask, shitty pillows. I often have to make do and suck it up.Not getting good sleep every night may be even healthy for your system. It must be a natural part of our existence as a species, and hence, dare I say it… good for you?Tags:sleepresttravelingnaturalPrevious\"A Miracle Formula For Making Ideas A Reality (For You And Your Friends)\"Next\"How To Deal With Perfectionism Without Being Afraid of Imperfect Results\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

      "content": "PostsI used to be extremely rigid with eating three meals a day, plus an occasional snack. Then I evolved to be more like my ancient ancestors.Skipping A Meal Brings You Closer To Your AncestorsSimon Myazin,August 22nd, 2020I had a discussion with some friends about having regular meals. I used to be extremely rigid with eating three meals a day, plus an occasional snack. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” some people believe. Lunch is a vital divider of the day – for certain nations it’s the reason to have a siesta, usually after a carb-heavy intake. Dinner is a sacred ritual, some like to have it around 5pm, others wait until it’s dark outside. Regardless of what eating schedule you follow I’ve got a surprising fact for you: an obligation to gobble up a hefty portion of proteins and carbs is often an illusion.In recent years, with the wave of biohacking entering the worldwide pop-culture arena, all kinds of diets started being invented and promoted by those questioning theS.A.D.and other well-established western regimens. You have your Atkins, your paleo, your carnivore, your vegan and a myriad more, all challenging the pyramid and captivating minds and stomachs.I remember I used to go into a frenzy if my regular lunch hour was slipping away. I had to have my meal! When my mom visited me she would laugh about my dependency on food that I had to fetch “right there, right now.” I would frantically yelp the closest to my current location Vietnamese or Thai restaurant that had to have at least a 4.2-star customer rating. Nothing wrong with that. But I don’t have to have a meal every time and it’s totally OK to skip it once in a while. For breakfast I typically have nothing but a cup of black coffee (alright, sometimes it’sBulletproof™or black tea.) If lunch is delayed, I might just combine it with dinner, make it an early one. As primates, for thousands of years, we didn’t have the luxury of having access to virtually unlimited food banks 24/7. So what’s more natural – having regular three-times-a-day meals or eating a sun-dried leg of a deer once every 3 days?When a couple of people I know and whose opinion I respect taught me about intermittent fasting I learned first-hand that it’s not a matter of life and death to not eat whenever you have the urge. Another friend told me about her experience with a 24-hour dry fast and how it can be beneficial beyond belief. Did I pick up those rituals to make them a regular part of my life? Hell no, I’m not becoming religious about anything. But this information taught me that it’s easier than I thought to exercise restraint.I’m not calling for extreme mimicking of our ancient ancestors, no – try walking on all fours and hunting moose with rocks and sticks. All I’m saying is that when you are out and about, on a road trip in the mountains or visiting a national park and you don’t have lunch packed, just know that your body has more than enough resources to keep you going and enjoy your day. Don’t freak out. If nothing else, think about how much more enjoyable your next meal will be when you get to it.Tags:dietancestrypsychologyfoodPrevious\"Guilt-free Recharging Is Essential\"Next\"How I Stay Productive With My To-Do Lists\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.

But, like most early students of life, I was making a lot of mistakes: I wanted to be acknowledged at all costs, I tried to control what other people thought (of me), and I desired to feel good about myself 100% of the time.Until one day, Valeri said to me:\"Never expect gratitude from others.\"That day, my whole life changed.He broke it down for me, and I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.If you don't expect people to be thankful to you for all the good things you do for them, you have no reason to be disappointed when they fail to thank you.Not expecting gratitude frees you up from acting using purely selfish motives. Helping others solely for the purpose of earning their goodwill is no longer your goal.Most importantly, no longer do you worry about not being appreciated. There's no sense of incompleteness after each act of goodness. If you receive gratitude, it's great. If you don't, it's also okay. You don't need to be upset.Have you ever felt the weight of ungratefulness? Resentment and expectations cause you to damage relationships?Leave a comment below... and thank you. :)Tags:psychologyserenityPrevious\"Benchmarking the Beach Office\"Next\"The Best Way To Get Started Learning About Being A Digital Nomad\"Site Profile{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"theme\": \"entrepreneur\",\n    \"location\": \"an undisclosed location\",\n    \"URL\": \"https://simon.rapidsystemshub.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"/images/og-image-sm.jpg\",\n    \"homepageImage\": \"/images/about/simon-chi-laptop.jpeg\",\n    \"favicon\": \"/images/favicon-simon.png\",\n    \"siteLogo\": \"/images/simon-logo-3d-out2.svg\",\n    \"siteName\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"author\": \"Simon Myazin\",\n    \"alias\": \"simon\",\n    \"headline\": \"Learn to Hack Life: Knowledge Work Meets Zen and World Travel\",\n    \"description\": \"Creator, Designer, Traveler, Mentor.
