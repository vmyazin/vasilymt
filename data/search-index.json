with you by friends and family the whirlwind of constant bits of information sucks you in and you don t even notice its effect until you find yourself in the middle of it fully buried important why you should care when all of your mental receptors are constantly in the mode of receiving information unfiltered and relentless you expend a lot of energy often without even realizing it our brains are simply not evolved to deal with such an avalanche of information to process a lot of it seems important and we do our best to give it every bit of our attention it doesn t help that information spreaders use tricks like putting the words such as must see important you won t believe it into the headlines our communication patterns since childhood taught us that if something is declared to be significant it ought to be that turns out it s not always true out there on the internet our compliance and curiosity are being taken advantage of masterfully what we don t see when we are on autopilot a keen observer may even accuse me of manipulating minds with the title of this article i ll admit it i tend to play by the rules of the modern age to even have a slim chance to get to my readers yet here i faithfully suggest that you try the below mentioned steps to take a vacation from the constant information flow without self-awareness and restraining we constantly stress ourselves out and give up control to the forces that don t have our best interest in mind excessive amounts of cortisol a hormone that controls our mood motivation and fear wears us down unnecessarily the brain doesn t always know the difference between a real and a perceived threat breaking free from the news ignore any links with sensational and manipulative titles allow yourself to skip them even if they were shared by your friends and family you can still thank them if they insist on knowing whether you watched or read it you can politely explain that you either didn t have the time or are currently going light on the news say no to the news programs even the short clips on youtube that are so easy to get hooked on with the recommendation engine it can get highly intelligent sometimes it s totally sinister also definitely remove any general news apps from your devices use ad blocking i recomend brave browser that is not too different from chrome and safari but it comes with a built-in advertisement blocker that works most of the time there are extensions for all web browsers that you can install too use extensions that hide the news in your social media sites facebook feed remover youtube feed remover twitter trends remover remove the social media apps from your phone if you can t commit to doing it as a permanent change give yourself a timeframe 3 days one week two weeks remove them and set a reminder to bring them back hey siri remind me to reinstall twitter and instagram in two weeks then see how you feel have specific time windows to check your inboxes for example you can agree with yourself to only check your phone or an email app on your laptop four times a day once in the morning for 10 mins then once before lunch once in the afternoon around 4 30 then once after dinner it s helpful to write these down on a piece of paper and put next to your work area stay with this schedule for three days see how you feel take stock of how information consumption makes you feel and choose healthy replacements think about replacing your fast food news and netflix series items with offline activities choose to go for a walk a bicycle ride or a physical book instead i find it helpful to build healthy replacement links meaning connections or associations if i get an urge to read the news i instead read a few pages of a book instead of watching an episode of a show i ll walk around the block make your policy known casually explain to people in your circle that you may not get back to them immediately if you are concerned about missing something important make sure you let the important people in your life know that you can be reached by a text or whatsapp message where they d ideally need to mention what the urgency is chances are 90 of other people s urgencies are not so crucial in your life in conclusion if you read this far you likely share my concerns about ever-present information streams consuming our minds first comes awareness then plan of action i

almost demeaned your ability you did it all correctly and for some reason your boss still didn t acknowledge your accomplishment on the contrary he found several things to criticize what a dick there s a fancy name for this feeling you were dealing with the dunning kruger effect dunning kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability it comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability wikipedia how about feeling underqualified you said you could do it but when you got to it you had that sinking feeling that you would embarrass yourself and others you delivered the results you got massive praise yet you still felt like you didn t do a good enough job and let others down your peers thanked you your boss recommended you for a promotion at the same time you couldn t shake off the feeling that you somehow tricked them into believing in you in this case you were experiencing impostor syndrome impostor syndrome also known as impostor phenomenon impostorism fraud syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud wikipedia despite ample external evidence of their competence those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve what they have achieved individuals with impostor syndrome incorrectly attribute their success to luck or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are smarter than they perceive themselves to be why it is essential to keep track of where you are on the mental scale living between those states can be a grueling reality if you are like me you ve experienced both of them on the regular if you are a victim of your mind that loses coordinates of common sense it can be highly taxing on your daily energy and mental health without the self-awareness of metacognition people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence metacognition is thinking about one s thinking it refers to the processes used to plan observe and assess one s understanding and performance for me keeping the daily energy levels high and have peace of mind are among the top priorities in life that s why i must go through regular exercises in self-assessment where am i on the scale at this moment for example who am i to pose as an expert writer on the subject i m just a guy with enough motivation to research the subjects skim wikipedia type up an article and publish it for the world to see are there more prominent experts on this subject than me yes did my reader already know about these topics and reading my article was a waste of their time possibly yet i believe it should never be a reason for me to lose motivation and resort to inactivity become better at self-assessment i cannot overstate the importance of being self-aware it s one of the keys to harmonious living ask yourself questions that will help you self-assess where you stand on a given topic we can use some ideas offered by nancy chick of vanderbilt university ideally i would take some time to write down my thoughts answering the following questions preassessment what do i already know about this topic that could guide me while performing the tasks at hand the muddiest point what is most confusing to me about the tasks i need to work on today retrospective postassessment before evaluating this subject i thought it was now i think that it is or how is my thinking changing or not changing over time reflective journaling what about my process worked well that i should remember to do next time what did not work so well that i should not do next time or that i should change if this approach is too scientific for you you can simply add the self-assessment idea to your mental toolkit keep it less formal remember to pause your busy work once in a while and think about your approach to getting things done simply ask yourself am i competent about what i m doing and whether or not i am am i open to feedback and learning vasily self-reflects until reaching a perfectly balanced state photo by nick buneev what improved self-awareness will offer you with raised self-awareness you will begin noticing areas in your personal and professional life where you ve been staying mindless of your objective state simply put you thought you were excellent where you weren t and believed you sucked at things you were actually fantastic at it can be quite unsettling to gain awareness of your mind s tricks and short-comings countless times i experienced a sudden or gradual realization that i was not cut out for the job i was then faced with either appealing to the stakeholder to transfer it to somebody else or to grind it out bury myself in books and raise my competency both are tough choices as they require you to battle with your ego however the consequences of skating through towards a mediocre result or a downright failure can lead to a much larger frustration for everyone involved if you apply self-assessment as a regular exercise your day-to-day life will gradually improve it will lead you to better decision-making you will waste your and other s time much less at the end of the day it s a balancing act i don t believe i will ever fully understand if i m genuinely great or kind of subpar at anything but at least i will always have the means to analyze my efforts psychology is fascinating do you have any examples of when you felt this way let me know by email or on social media",

      "content": "those who know me personally are familiar with my insatiable appetite for traveling be it around the current locale a next city over or long-distance international travel i love to traverse the globe it wasn t innate in me to be comfortable with not knowing what exactly to expect on the other side to set the stage for you i typically travel alone that s my favorite way so far the points i share below are made with the solo traveler in mind but can be applied to couples and groups of tight friends as well it took some effort and experience to adjust myself to regularly changing dwellings especially when it comes to sleep it helps to pack earplugs a blackout eye mask and maybe even your own pillow if you can fit it in your luggage sleep is a whole subject of its own however in this article i will share my quick thoughts on how i settle into a new place easier meditate at the new place to connect with my new room i often try to meditate there soon after checking-in 5-10 minutes of sitting in silence with my eye shut on top of the bed is enough to ease in and calmly integrate with the new environment it also trains my brain that this space is suitable for remaining calm put out mementos to build continuity between my previous place and the new one i put out some mementos which can be practical objects such as a book a coaster a postcard maybe even post-it notes with some reminders that i stick on the new desk there is a risk of leaving these behind upon checking out but treat it as an inevitable cycle and an exercise of letting go light up an incense i carry a small wooden case full of incense that i burn at a new place to make it smell familiar my favorite is the classic nag champa of indian origin and the variants from the same brand in my experience most people like its fragrance and it sets a calm relaxing ambiance take a walk around the block shortly after getting settled in i change into comfortable clothes and shoes aiming to blend in with the local crowd if possible and take a walk around the block maybe even 2-3 blocks this helps me to kick-start assimilating in the new neighborhood take notes of what s around feel the pulse of the area i notice the locations of convenience shops restaurants food trucks supermarkets so that i can plan my errands easier in the days to come watch a favorite show or a comforting video continuing with simple and comforting activities in the new place also allows to bridge the gap between locations if i am currently in watching a series i ll hook up my laptop with an hdmi cable to the tv i try to pick apartments and hotel room with a nice flat panel and watch another episode it can be something nice on youtube as well one example of how i get fired up about exploring the town i arrived in is to watch an anthony bordain show about it if available make a simple meal inside if the place has a kitchen i take a trip to the local supermarket and get some basic groceries to make myself a simple meal even if street food is king in this town there is something grounding and calming about using the new kitchen space it s another way to connect and feel like a local experiencing the place like a native is an undeniable source of joy and you still travel with the mindset of a foreign explorer i highly recommend you meditate on reframing it towards full immersion shopping and then cooking with local ingredients is one step towards it overall exercising my ability to be calm and comfortable in potentially uncomfortable and disturbing circumstances was the main factor in becoming better at grounding myself during the ever changing settings it s imperative to be able to take a deep breath and stay composed i need all the energy i can conserve to later use on exploring new territories connecting with the locals and delivering kick-ass work while jockeying my laptop boa viagem",

      "content": "if you do your work mostly on your laptop don t need to go to the office and like to travel this article is for you there s so much out there waiting for you to explore that you feel restless what if you moved to a new city for a month or even three months what s the first step to starting your digital nomad journey no it s not buying a fancy backpack a pair of comfortable tennis shoes or adding digital nomad in your social media bios while those are all fine things to do they are not the most important ones and what you start with choosing the right destination for an extended stay is crucial you need to know that you are going to a place suitable for you here are the ingredients of a digital nomad-friendly city that i consider fundamental budget accommodation fast and accessible internet safety food people locals digital nomad community infrastructure walkability budget lower than where you are now cost of living is high on the list because one of the key reasons to leave your current city is that elsewhere is less expensive part of the geo-arbitrage equation is lowered expenses you earn good money from your home base and make your cash go a long way in a cheaper country it doesn t make much sense to stay somewhere for months if it s significantly more expensive than where you came from unless you re obsessed with visiting a certain city and want to splurge on it zurich tel aviv new york city in the meantime my focus is on where you can save money accommodation abundance choose a city with a wide variety of apartments rooms hotels and co-living spaces check airbnb and booking com in advance to make sure that there are loads of options in the city center you d be surprised but some cities don t have very many budget-friendly and high-quality options bratislava moscow even though the country itself might not be that pricey send a message to the owner to ask if the internet speed is good at their rental when you work remotely stable connectivity is critical this brings me to the next point internet speed and wifi availability you can t do your work without the internet it s great to have a fast and steady wifi connection at the rental place many cities have cafes where you can connect to their wifi i like to find five or more of those and rotate my visits if you don t mind spending a little money coworking spaces are a good place to get your work done and they usually guarantee great wifi wework is a fantastic worldwide chain of high-end coworking spaces that i used in the us brazil argentina england czechia and more one access keycard unlocks all of them get a local sim card maybe even two if the wifi is down you can use a cellular data connection as backup if you can get unlimited go for it safety and security not all digital nomad-friendly places have an equal safety situation there are some cities that are excellent in everything except crime rates rio de janeiro medellin it varies for men and women and lgbt folks men can generally endure a higher-risk environment while more vulnerable travelers will be more comfortable in well-known safer places bangkok budapest berlin lisbon for beginner nomads of all backgrounds it s recommended to settle into the new lifestyle in a widely recognized safe city it could be even in your own country if it makes you feel more secure food options part of the excitement of traveling to a new city or country is trying the local cuisine make sure you are into the type of food common at your destination research if the place has international cuisines as well for the especially budget-conscious travelers i recommend knowing the local version of fast food sometimes it s vibrant fresh and inexpensive thai brazilian mexican the place might not be a good choice if you don t like local foods photo by helena lopes pexels people are the locals friendly both to foreigners and to each other in some places people are just amazingly nice in others they are cold and keep to themselves the local people truly make or break a destination knowing their language or having the ability to converse in english or another middle language will help you integrate quickly are there digital nomads already it makes the stay much more social and less lonely when there is an instant community of people similar to you make new friends go out for group dinners or go hiking together to fill your time with fun social activities sites like meetup com and nomadlist com will help you find events and meetups happening in your new base infrastructure public transportation taxis rentals the more developed the infrastructure is the better obviously smoothly paved sidewalks and motorways bike lanes and functioning traffic lights are desirable it can take some time to adjust to local transportation traditions in some places such as motorbiking in south east asia if you can count on uber or similar e-hail apps it s a huge plus not all cities permit official city taxi replacements and it can cause a major inconvenience under- and overground trains are excellent and cheap in many cities and i highly recommend figuring them out quickly after you settle down the people-watching opportunities are priceless these days many cities have bicycles e-scooters and e-bikes for rent by the minute those can be a great alternative to public transportation and taxis walkability levels exploring a city on foot is a fantastic way to be fit and never be bored not all cities are created equally walkable i m looking at you us and canada reasons for that may be in the way the cities are planned giving preference to car drivers over pedestrians or due to the safety situation however be aware of whether or not it is safe and comfortable to walk in the city climate and weather conditions can also be factors even the most walkable cities might not be enjoyable in the rainy or cold seasons i consider walkability one of the biggest motivations to spend an extended time in a city notable examples are most european cities followed by tokyo new york and buenos aires one of the ways to gauge how walkable the place is is to use nomad list s filters it s not super accurate but it covers all of the known digital nomad locations in the world you may need to sign up for it to see the filters but if you are serious about being a remote worker who escapes icy winters and wants to connect to the community i m telling you nomadlist is worth it this is an unpaid endorsement another great website to research walkability is walkscore com type in a city and get a score of 1 to 100 the site is generally geared towards usa and canada but you can get scores on international cities as well be sure to check out their travel time map feature alternatively you can simply google how walkable is city name and see what other people said choose a place and get moving with these general criteria in mind you can make an excellent choice for your subsequent journeys as a digital nomad this list is by no means exhaustive there are plenty of other factors to consider gyms parks dating scene visa rules bureaucracy quality of coffee coworking spaces and more going on your initial remote worker stint should be fun and easy and thankfully there are dozens of excellent locations you cannot go wrong with once you get your feet wet you can apply your personal experience-based system for selecting a destination enjoy your travels to the fullest",
