I wouldn't call myself the most prolific expert in productivity.

However, I have spent years reading and learning about getting things done effectively. In my own life, I have probably spent more than 867 hours improving my workflows.

I'm not a fan of complicated systems like GTD. Cal Newport's ["Deep Work"](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) approach is more my style.

## Here's how I first got interested in productivity:

For the longest time, I thought I was accomplishing quite a lot. Then, about two years ago, I began working with a business coach who was able to pinpoint ways in which I was wasting time and procrastinating. 

One stormy summer evening in South Florida I was in my room, on a Zoom call with the coach who at the time was on an island in Thailand.

He shared with me that he had given up on music as a hobby in order to pursue his goal to *gain freedom*. To get his business up and running **he had to sacrifice** a lot of pleasant activities.

He told me to remove all games from my iPhone, stop watching YouTube and Netflix for entertainment, and drop a number of superfluous but dopamine-inducing things that didn't help me advance toward my goals.

It's a very **delicate balance** between achieving results and spending recreational time.

You must be tuned in to the sense of where you're simply procrastinating versus recharging.

## So my goal over the next year is:

**Recognize** when I do things that don't matter and **stop** doing them.

I don't want to learn yet another technique to be more productive.

What's important is to never lose sight of where your **time** goes and make a judgment about whether or not was spent wisely. After all, it's the only resource **we cannot make more of**.
