          p Born in Lipetsk, Russia in the decade of the sunsetting of the Soviet Union Vasily spent his formative years in creative environments. Surrounded by writers, artists, designers, programmers he was bound to be on the crossroads of creativity.
          
          p Vasily embodies the idealistic age of yore and the pragmatic fast-paced new era of rapidly developing technology. Naturally curious he connects the dots between tribal mysticism, applied phylosophy, wide-range frequency beats and graphical user interface. 
          p Yes, he does feel a bit odd describing himself in third person.
