          p Born in Russia in the decade of the sunsetting of the Soviet Union #{config.websitePerson} spent his formative years in creative environments. Surrounded by writers, artists, designers, programmers he was bound to be on the crossroads of creativity.
          
          p #{config.websitePerson} embodies the idealistic age of yore and the pragmatic fast-paced new era of rapidly developing technology. Naturally curious he connects the dots between tribal mysticism, applied phylosophy, wide-range frequency beats and graphical user interface.
